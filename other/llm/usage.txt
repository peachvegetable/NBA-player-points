the log transformation seems to be a great way of fixing the issue, how do you do this while generating the model, here is the snippet: # Second model with feature engineering
analysis_data_1 <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")
analysis_data_1 <- analysis_data_1 |>
  mutate(
    pts_per_min = pts / mp,
    tov_per_game = tov /g,
    pf_per_game = pf / g
  )

### Model data ####

set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
data_split <- initial_split(analysis_data_1, prop = 0.8)
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)

# preprocesssing with recipe
data_recipe <- recipe(pts ~ ., data = train_data) |>
  step_rm(rk) |>
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) |>
  step_dummy(broad_position)

lasso_spec <- linear_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = 1) |>
  set_engine("glmnet")

# create the workflow
lasso_workflow <- workflow() |>
  add_recipe(data_recipe) |>
  add_model(lasso_spec)

# tune the model for the best lambda
set.seed(123)
# cross-validation setup
cv_folds <- vfold_cv(train_data, v = 5)

lasso_results <- tune_grid(
  lasso_workflow,
  resamples = cv_folds,
  grid = 50
)

best_result <- lasso_results |>
  collect_metrics() |>
  filter(.metric == "rmse") |>
  arrange(mean) |>
  slice(1) |>
  select(penalty)

final_lasso_workflow <- finalize_workflow(
  lasso_workflow,
  best_result
)

# fit the model
second_lasso_model <- fit(final_lasso_workflow, data = train_data)

To implement log transformation in your model generation process, you would need to adjust the target variable (pts) in your recipe by applying a log transformation. Here's how you can modify the snippet you provided:

Transform the pts column using log() in your data processing step.
Modify the data_recipe to use the transformed points for modeling.
After fitting the model and making predictions, apply the exponential function to transform your predictions back to the original scale.
Here's the modified code:

r
Copy code
library(tidymodels)
library(dplyr)
library(readr) # for read_parquet

# Read in the data
analysis_data_1 <- read_parquet("data/analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Apply feature engineering
analysis_data_1 <- analysis_data_1 %>%
  mutate(
    pts_per_min = pts / mp,
    tov_per_game = tov / g,
    pf_per_game = pf / g,
    pts_log = log(pts + 1)  # Add 1 to avoid log(0)
  )

### Model data ####

set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
data_split <- initial_split(analysis_data_1, prop = 0.8)
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)

# Preprocessing with recipe
# Use the log-transformed points 'pts_log' as the response
data_recipe <- recipe(pts_log ~ ., data = train_data) %>%
  step_rm(rk) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())

lasso_spec <- linear_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = 1) %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")

# Create the workflow
lasso_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(data_recipe) %>%
  add_model(lasso_spec)

# Tune the model for the best lambda
set.seed(123)
# Cross-validation setup
cv_folds <- vfold_cv(train_data, v = 5)

lasso_results <- tune_grid(
  lasso_workflow,
  resamples = cv_folds,
  grid = 50
)

best_result <- lasso_results %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  filter(.metric == "rmse") %>%
  arrange(mean) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  pull(penalty) # Use 'pull' instead of 'select' to get a single value

# Finalize the workflow with the best lambda
final_lasso_workflow <- finalize_workflow(
  lasso_workflow,
  list(penalty = best_result)
)

# Fit the final model
second_lasso_model <- fit(final_lasso_workflow, data = train_data)

# Make predictions on the test data and convert back from log scale
test_predictions <- predict(second_lasso_model, test_data) %>%
  mutate(.pred = exp(.pred) - 1)  # Inverse log transformation

# Your test_predictions now contain the predicted points in the original scale
In this code, exp(.pred) - 1 is the inverse of log(pts + 1), which transforms the predictions back to the original points scale. The use of pull(penalty) instead of select(penalty) is to ensure that best_result is a single value that can be used in finalize_workflow(). Make sure to apply the inverse log transformation to any predictions you make to interpret them correctly in the context of actual points.

why applying log to pts would avoid neg values

ChatGPT
Applying a log transformation to the target variable in a regression context serves several purposes and can indirectly help avoid unrealistic negative predictions. Here's why:

Range Restriction: The logarithm of any positive number is defined and positive. Since we're dealing with counts (like points in a game), the actual logged values will never be negative. When you exponentiate the predicted log values (the inverse operation), the results will always be positive, because e^x is always positive for any real number x.
Variance Stabilization: The log transformation can stabilize the variance of a dataset, especially for count data which often follows a Poisson distribution where the variance is equal to the mean. By stabilizing variance, the transformation can lead to better model performance and more reliable estimates.
Error Distribution Normalization: Log transformation can help in achieving a more normal-like distribution for the errors, which is an assumption in many regression models. If the target variable is highly skewed, a log transformation can reduce skewness, leading to better model fit and predictions.
Multiplicative to Additive Relationship: If the relationship between the independent variables and the target variable is multiplicative rather than additive (e.g., a 10% increase in minutes played leads to a 10% increase in points scored), a log transformation linearizes this relationship, allowing it to be modeled more effectively with linear regression techniques.
Outlier Impact Reduction: The log transformation reduces the impact of outliers since it compresses the scale. This can prevent the model from being too influenced by extreme values, which could otherwise lead to erratic predictions including negative values.
Model Fit Improvement: By making the data adhere more closely to the assumptions of linear regression (normal distribution of errors, homoscedasticity), the log transformation often improves the overall fit of the model, potentially leading to more accurate predictions.
However, itâ€™s important to note that the log transformation is not a panacea and may not be appropriate for all situations, especially if the target variable contains zeros, since the logarithm of zero is undefined. In such cases, adding a small constant to the target variable before logging (log(x + 1)) can help to mitigate this issue. After making predictions, you would then exponentiate and subtract this constant to get back to the original scale.
